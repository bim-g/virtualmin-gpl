<header>Backup destination display options</header>

Controls how the backup destination appears in tables. You can choose to show
just the provider name, the full path, or set a character limit. If the path is
longer than the limit, the directory in the path is hidden, and only the file
name is shown. This only affects the display and does not change the actual
backup destination.
