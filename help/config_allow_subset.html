<header>Allow SSL certificate request for a subset of hostnames?</header>

By default when this option is set to <b>No</b>, a request for an SSL
certificate from an ACME provider like Let's Encrypt will only succeed if
all hostnames could be validated. However, changing it to <b>Yes</b> allows
requests to partially succeed, which increases the chance of success but may
cause certificates to be incomplete in the face of network flakyness. <p>
