<header>Exclude unverifiable hostnames?</header>

By default when this option is set to <b>No</b>, a request for an SSL
certificate from an ACME provider like Let's Encrypt will only succeed if
all hostnames could be validated. However, changing it to <b>Yes</b> allows
requests to partially succeed, but excluding from the certificate hostnames
that cannot be verified. <p>
