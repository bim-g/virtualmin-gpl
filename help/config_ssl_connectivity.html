<header>Check before certificate request</header>

This option determines what connectivity checks are performed by default
when requesting an SSL certificate from a provider, to avoid failed requests
for domains that are not properly configured. The options are : <p>

<ul>
<li><b>Test connectivity</b> - Test that the domain can accept HTTP connections from the rest of the internet, using Virtualmin's connectivity check service.
<li><b>Validate domain</b> - Run Virtualmin's config validation checks for the website and DNS records.
<li><b>Skip tests</b> - No testing is done.
</ul>
