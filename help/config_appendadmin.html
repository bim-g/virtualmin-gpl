<header>Include domain name in extra admin usernames?</header>

This option selects how usernames for domain extra admins will be generated.  By default, Virtualmin will use the base username requested, and report an error
if there is a clash with any other domain. However, selecting <b>Yes</b> here
will cause the username to have the first part of the domain appended or
prepended, as determined by the <b>Domain name style in usernames</b>
config option. <p>
