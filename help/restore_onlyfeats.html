<header>Create new virtual servers with only selected features?</header>

When this option is selected and a restored virtual server does not already
exist on the system, it will be created with only the features selected to
restore enabled. Otherwise all features that were originally enabled for
the server will be enabled, even if only some of them are restored. <p>
