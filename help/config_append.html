<header>Include domain name in mailbox usernames?</header>

This option selects how usernames for mail and FTP users will be generated.  By default, Virtualmin will use the base username requested, but if it clashes with an existing username it will append the domainname in the manner specified in the next option.  If consistency is preferable, set this to "Always", and all usernames within sub-servers will have the domain name appended.
