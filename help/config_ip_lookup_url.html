<header>HTTP service URL for system external IP detection</header>

Use this field to find your server's public IPs—IPv4 and IPv6—using a web
service. If your server uses IPv6, enter two URLs separated by a space: one for
IPv4-only and one for IPv6-only. If not, enter just the IPv4 URL. <p>
        
The default pair is <tt>http://v4.software.virtualmin.com/cgi-bin/ip.cgi
http://v6.software.virtualmin.com/cgi-bin/ip.cgi</tt>. You can also use other
services like <tt>https://api.ipify.org https://api6.ipify.org</tt>.
